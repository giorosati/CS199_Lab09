The program can be compiled by typing "make all" and an executable file named “prog” will be created in the same directory. 

Typing "make clean" will remove the prog file.

The program lets the user choose from three different types of data to create a linked list:
1) int
2) doublt
3) string

Because myLL class and the node struct were created with templates for the data stored in the value data member, 
the same class and struct can be used for all three data types.

The main.cpp file (which has the main() function) essentially just serves the purpose of displaying menus and collecting user imputs.

This program has been tested wtih data types of int, double, and string. It was compiled and tested on FLIP.
