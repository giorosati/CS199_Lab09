Lab 9 README
CS_199_400_W2016


The program can be compiled by typing "make all" and an executable file named “prog” will be created in the same directory. 

Typing "make clean" will remove the prog file.

The program lets the user choose from three different types of data to create a linked list:
1) int
2) double
3) string

Because myLL class and the node struct were created with templates for the data stored in the value data member, 
the myLL and Node can be used for all three data types.

The supplied lab9.cpp file (which has the main() function) serves the purpose of displaying menus, getting user imputs, and then calling the functions of myLL.

This program was compiled and tested on FLIP and has been tested with int, double, and string data types.
